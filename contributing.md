* Submit an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/nerivo/data-science-design/issues)


#### The mechanics of contributing:

* Fork this repo to your Github account
* Clone your version on your account down to your machine from your account, e.g,. `git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/data-science-design.git`
* Make sure to track progress upstream (i.e., on our version of `data-science-design` at `nerivo/data-science-design`) by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/nerivo/data-science-design.git`. Before making changes make sure to pull changes in from upstream by doing either `git fetch upstream` then merge later or `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step
* Make your changes (bonus points for making changes on a new feature branch)
* Push up to your account
* Submit a pull request to the master branch at `nerivo/data-science-design`
