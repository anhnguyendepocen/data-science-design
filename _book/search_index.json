["example-project-plan.html", "Chapter 8 Example project plan", " Chapter 8 Example project plan Between the two of us, we have designed, managed or delivered hundreds of projects. Despite that experience, the process can still be uncomfortable and disorienting. This is especially true for Phase 4, in which you have to create concrete details about your execution plan. Many find this especially daunting: it’s a subjective endeavour with no right answers – what might be best for one project may be well off-the-mark for another. We felt it would be valuable, then, to show an example of how we might present a project plan in the form of a written proposal. The example below is based on a real proposal we wrote. It is, by no means, the only way this project could have been designed, nor is it clear that this was the best way. It was simply the way we approached the task. We hope the example is useful to you. Proposal for Client X Introduction: Client X specialises in creating high-performance, affordable exercise gear for serious and recreational runners alike. Their vision is to create an online shopping experience for their customers, in which they can shop for shoes, apparel and accessories without having to walk into a store. However, this vision comes with understandable obstacles, such as how to convince customers that an online shopping experience can match the experience they would expect in-store, which has the benefit of allowing a customer to try on several sizes and models. Furthermore, many customers have reported that working with a sales associate directly gives them more confidence that the suggestions brought before them are personalised in a way that an online shopping experience cannot match. Client X would like to dispel this rumour by making the Client X online shopping experience more personalised. In this proposal, we outline a project in which we will develop a personalised recommendation engine for Client X, which will employ innovative approaches to understanding Client X customers. Project description: In this proposal, we outline a project aimed at helping Client X create a more personalised customer experience. We will focus on two main objectives: (1) analysis on customer segments and (2) the development of a recommendation engine. We feel that these two branches of the project will combine to give Client X a better understanding of their customers’ tastes and preferences and will allow them to deliver a more personalised customer experience. In Objective 1, “Customer Insights”, we will perform a customer segmentation analysis on data from Client X’s CRM (Customer Relationship Management), sales and marketing systems. We will first perform an in-depth analysis of the Client X data in which we will assess data quality and completeness and perform preliminary exploratory analyses, looking for clear relationships between the features available. We will then, in conjunction with Client X staff, select a subset of features that we feel have the most utility for separating customers into meaningful, interpretable segments. To achieve this we will take an unsupervised approach, exploring several clustering methodologies before determining which we feel has the most promise for this particular dataset. When performing cluster analysis, an important consideration is in determining the optimal number of clusters. While techniques such as the elbow method can be useful in arriving at this number, we feel it will also be important to sense-check the outcome with Client X stakeholders who understand their customers the best. Thus, throughout this project, we will have regular progress updates with Client X to show our findings and illustrate descriptive analyses of how the resultant clusters differ from one another. In Objective 2, “Product recommendations”, we will focus on building a recommender system that can be used to suggest products to Client X customers. Our plan is to use collaborative filtering in combination with the customer segments identified in Objective 1, however we may find through the course of researching this project that a different approach is more appropriate. We have, therefore, broken this project into two discrete phases: research and building. The research phase will explore various recommender system approaches with a view to gain enough knowledge to choose a single best option for the build phase, in which we will productionise an engine that runs on the Client X Google Cloud Platform instance, ingesting data from the Client X datastores and returning the outcome via an API. We will work with the Client X engineering team to ensure that the API produced returns information in a format that can be processed by the rest of the Client X data infrastructure. We outline the plan for this project in below. Project Proposal: Customer Insights and Recommendations Objective:This project is aimed at developing a personalised recommendation engine that will employ innovative approaches to understanding Client X customers.

["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 The challenges when embarking on a data science project? 1.2 Our framework 1.3 Organisation of this book", " Chapter 1 Introduction The past decade has seen an explosion of technological innovations, perhaps none of which more seismic for both businesses and individuals than the field of data science. Indeed, the ability to apply advanced analytics to business challenges can be exciting, fruitful and fun. With recent advances in computational capabilities and cost-effective data collection and storage solutions, applying data science to business challenges is now within the reach of most business owners. Getting started with data science can be daunting, and for the non-specialist, exactly how to begin a data science journey can be unclear. Just like software engineering projects, data science projects require specific design strategies. Our personal experience designing data science projects in a wide range of industries and sectors has given us an understanding of how to make this journey successful and how to work with stakeholders in order to identify the most impactful business questions and formulate scientific approaches to answer them. In this book, we share our learnings about sensible approaches to designing data science projects. We offer a framework that we have found to be useful in ensuring successful project outcomes and walk the reader through the process of using this framework for their own data science endeavours. Our goal is to provide a resource that data science practitioners can use in their own work and give business leaders an insight into the steps that go into building a data science project from scratch. 1.1 The challenges when embarking on a data science project? For data scientists who are new to the field, perhaps the single most challenging aspect of the role is not technical but rather conceptual: learning how to design a successful data science project. Often this means breaking down a complex business case into concrete objectives and specific questions. In our roles as mentors and project managers, we too-often see data scientists attack an analysis without first identifying the underlying questions. These can be specific questions about the scientific approach – “What is the hypothesis of this experiment?” or “What statistical question am I asking my model to answer? – to more general ones, such as, “Why are we doing this?”, “What is an ideal outcome?”, “What would constitute a failure?” or “What is the business problem we are trying to solve?” As we tell our mentees, this approach is like building a house without a blueprint: you might hammer together some bits of wood in a useful way, but without understanding the objectives of the project as a whole, success is essentially impossible. Project design is difficult: it can be loosely structured and often has no single correct answer. This can often be disorienting. How-best to approach this task has been considered and discussed often, and many learnings have been derived from the methodologies found in fields such as product design or design engineering. For an excellent discussion of this topic, we recommend eppisodes 63 - 70 of the podcast Not So Standard Deviations, in which hosts Roger Peng and Hilary Parker discuss the Nigel Cross book Design Thinking and draw parallels to applications in data science. We often think of data science as a process by which we frame a business problem as a scientific question and apply scientific methodologies to answer that question and derive insights. But how do we identify the business question in the first place? As a data scientist, a good first step is to ask different stakeholders. Yet in our experience, this can often be an unsatisfying approach: more often than not, our clients/managers will not have a clearly-defined business problem or a concrete objective for the project. We believe our framework can help drive this conversation, setting the stage for well-planned project design and giving projects the best chances for success. 1.2 Our framework Our framework has two related components: project execution and project evaluation. While the temptation may be to view these in series, we have found that these components are in fact intertwined; each has a use on its own, but the framework yields the best results when they are used together. In the following chapters we outline these components, counterintuitively starting with evaluation and then moving on to execution. Why do we start with evaluation? We have found that thinking about what you want the final successful project to look like can help in planning how to get there. In short, we recommend starting with a zoomed-out view of the project as a whole and the context into which fits before considering the details of how you might get there. We can think of the analogy of taking a road-trip across the country: a sensible approach is to first think about what you want to get out of the journey and what are the major milestones you want to achieve before determining exactly which roads you will take to get there. This has echoes in Test Driven Development (TDD), a common approach to software development in which one first defines the criteria that the final code should adhere to and creates the corresponding tests before writing the actual code. 1.3 Organisation of this book This book is divided into two parts. In Part 1 we discuss our approach to designing and executing data science projects. Chapter 2 covers the four levels of project evaluation in more detail and provides examples of how to assess each. In Chapter 3 we move on to the phases of project delivery. Two of these phases are then explored in more detail: Project Definition (Chapter 4) and Project Execution (Chapter 5). Part 2 focuses on offering more concrete, practical advice. In Chapter 6 we provide an example of a project proposal that we might use when working with a client to define a project. Chapter 7 is primarily aimed at independent contractors/freelancers and covers how to build up a client base and find work. Chapter 8 lists some useful resources for where you can find help in the wider data science community. "]
