Indeed, the ability to apply advanced analytics to business challenges can be exciting, fruitful and fun. With recent advances in computational capabilities and cost-effective data collection and storage solutions, applying data science to business challenges is now within the reach of most business owners. Getting started with data science can be daunting, and for the non-specialist, exactly how to begin a data science journey can be unclear. Just like software engineering projects, data science projects require specific design strategies. Our personal experience designing data science projects in a wide range of industries and sectors has given us an understanding of how to make this journey successful and how to work with stakeholders in order to identify the most impactful business questions and formulate scientific approaches to answer them. In this book, we share our learnings about sensible approaches to designing data science projects. We offer a framework that we have found to be useful in ensuring successful project outcomes and walk the reader through the process of using this framework for their own data science endeavours. Our goal is to provide a resource that data science practitioners can use in their own work and give business leaders an insight into the steps that go into building a data science project from scratch. 1.1 The challenges when embarking on a data science project? For data scientists who are new to the field, perhaps the single most challenging aspect of the role is not technical but rather conceptual: learning how to design a successful data science project. Often this means breaking down a complex business case into concrete objectives and specific questions. In our roles as mentors and project managers, we too-often see data scientists attack an analysis without first identifying the underlying questions. These can be specific questions about the scientific approach – “What is the hypothesis of this experiment?” or “What statistical question am I asking my model to answer? – to more general ones, such as, “Why are we doing this?”, “What is an ideal outcome?”, “What would constitute a failure?” or “What is the business problem we are trying to solve?” As we tell our mentees, this approach is like building a house without a blueprint: you might hammer together some bits of wood in a useful way, but without understanding the objectives of the project as a whole, success is essentially impossible. Project design is difficult: it can be loosely structured and often has no single correct answer. This can often be disorienting. How-best to approach this task has been considered and discussed often, and many learnings have been derived from the methodologies found in fields such as product design or design engineering. For an excellent discussion of this topic, we recommend eppisodes 63 - 70 of the podcast Not So Standard Deviations, in which hosts Roger Peng and Hilary Parker discuss the Nigel Cross book Design Thinking and draw parallels to applications in data science. We often think of data science as a process by which we frame a business problem as a scientific question and apply scientific methodologies to answer that question and derive insights. But how do we identify the business question in the first place? As a data scientist, a good first step is to ask different stakeholders. Yet in our experience, this can often be an unsatisfying approach: more often than not, our clients/managers will not have a clearly-defined business problem or a concrete objective for the project. We believe our framework can help drive this conversation, setting the stage for well-planned project design and giving projects the best chances for success. 1.2 A note on data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence “Data science”, “machine learning” and “artificial intelligence” are terms that can be used in imprecise ways and can have overlapping meanings. Many will be familiar with the phenomenon of a job advertisement that is billed as a data scientist role but in reality is more of a data analyst or an IT specialist. AI is perhaps the most liberally-used of the terms, sure to increase one’s chances of writing a successful grant application or tender for a piece of work. It is safe to say that all of these terms can be susceptible to over-hype, and the choice of which to use often appears as a matter of marketing. But there are differences between them and it’s important to understand what those differences are. One of our favourite discussions about how these terms relate to one another comes from David Robinson: Data science produces insights Machine learning produces predictions Artificial intelligence produces actions To expand on this slightly, the goal of data science work is to gain insights and understanding into data. While the numerical patterns revealed may be clear and objective, the way these findings are interpreted requires a human in the loop. One way it differs from machine learning is that data science doesn’t necessarily involve modelling. We would also argue that it doesn’t necessarily involve coding or programming: there are plenty of data scientists that combine domain expertise with statistical inference using spreadsheets to acquire valuable insight. Machine learning extends data analytics into the realm of predictive modelling. This can be done in a highly automated way, although no machine learning system should be allowed to impact decision-making without a human in the loop. Machine learning models can range in complexity and interpretability. For example, linear regression is at the straight-forward end of the spectrum, so much so that many do not consider it machine learning at all. Deep learning models reside at the opposite end of the spectrum, with inner workings that are so opaque that it is essentially impossible to understand how the model makes its predictions. The difference between data science and machine learning is clearly not black and white but rather a spectrum or two domains that tend to overlap. Figure 1.1: xkcd.com Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence is the most common term that is most widely understood but is possibly also the hardest to distinguish between. Everyone will have their own view on this but to distinguish it from the other two terms we will define artificial intelligence as an actional application. This can be anything from robotics used in industries, chatbots providing customer service to game-playing algorithms using reinforcement learning. For the purpose of the book, we use the term data science throughout, just because we feel that this most accurately represents the type of projects we tackle but the reader can substitute the term with machine learning or artificial intelligence to suit their own needs. 1.3 Our framework Our framework has two related components: project execution and project evaluation. While the temptation may be to view these in series, we have found that these components are in fact intertwined; each has a use on its own, but the framework yields the best results when they are used together. In the following chapters we outline these components, counterintuitively starting with evaluation and then moving on to execution. Why do we start with evaluation? We have found that thinking about what you want the final successful project to look like can help in planning how to get there. In short, we recommend starting with a zoomed-out view of the project as a whole and the context into which fits before considering the details of how you might get there. We can think of the analogy of taking a road-trip across the country: a sensible approach is to first think about what you want to get out of the journey and what are the major milestones you want to achieve before determining exactly which roads you will take to get there. This has echoes in Test Driven Development (TDD), a common approach to software development in which one first defines the criteria that the final code should adhere to and creates the corresponding tests before writing the actual code. 1.4 Organisation of this book This book is divided into two parts. In Part 1 we discuss our approach to designing and executing data science projects. Chapter 2 covers the four levels of project evaluation in more detail and provides examples of how to assess each. In Chapter 3 we move on to the phases of project delivery. Two of these phases are then explored in more detail: Project Definition (Chapter 4) and Project Execution (Chapter 5). Part 2 focuses on offering more concrete, practical advice. In Chapter 6 we provide an example of a project proposal that we might use when working with a client to define a project. Chapter 7 is primarily aimed at independent contractors/freelancers and covers how to build up a client base and find work. Chapter 8 lists some useful resources for where you can find help in the wider data science community. "]
