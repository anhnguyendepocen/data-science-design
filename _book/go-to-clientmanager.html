<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Go to client/manager</h2>
<p>Going to your client/manager is not a stage in project execution per se because this should be something that is done regularly throughout the life of your project. It’s definitely not something that should be done only at the end once the project is complete. Instead, your client/manager should be contacted frequently as they are vitally important to the success of your project. You should include them frequently and give them a deep understanding of what you are working on.</p>
<p>Some find client/manager interactions to be difficult and stressful, and even the easiest client/manager relationships can become strained when a project doesn’t go according to plan. The most common problem is that people are busy and you might feel uncomfortable asking for their time. You may find that your client/manager does not want to be involved, or thinks that they don’t have much to contribute. Quite the contrary is true in reality: their involvement is crucial for project success. We recommend you emphasise this point early in your working relationship and make sure that your client/manager knows the expectations you have for their involvement.</p>
<p>The contrary can also be true, you could work with people who are overbearing and want to be too involved. This can often come across as micromanagement and as such, it is important to set boundaries early on. Agree on when you will have meetings and give updates so that you can free the rest of your day for productive work. Either way work on building a trusting relationship.</p>
<p>Often times clients/managers mistakenly believe that their role is to give you their requirements, data and infrastructure and that you will go away and silently build a product that is exactly what they imagined. Naturally, this is misguided: data science projects are complex and involve many decisions. While you may know the dataset and problem well, you will not be in a position to understand the business case as well as the client/manager. Some decisions are yours to make, but the responsibility for others lies squarely with the client/manager. You should not try to make these decisions on your own. If your client/manager resists, you should make every attempt to get your client/manager to understand that data science projects require an iterative process and the more that you can get their feedback the more the final product will meet their requirements.</p>
<p>Once you have convinced your client/manager of their involvement, plan regular meetings. In order to keep these meetings going, you need to make them see that the meetings are valuable to them, so use the time provided effectively. You can do this by planning the meeting in advance and taking ownership over the agenda. It is a good idea to prepare slides with any findings you have uncovered, visual representations of what you are working on or simply a list of questions to go through. People tend to be able to focus better on the problem at hand when they have something to look at.</p>
<p>Your client/manager will have a vision that they need to realise. You need to transform that vision into something tangible. Their vision will not likely be what you will end up delivering but in some ways might be better and in other ways worse. Everything is a trade-off and we need to make choices or the project will never finish and we would need an infinite budget. The problem is often that they will not understand the technical challenges and the trade-offs that you make. It is therefore essential that you get buy-in for the decisions that you make. Explain how making a certain decision impacts their vision but gets them the tangible results required.</p>
<p>Non-technical people often have different terms and terminology that they use to describe problems. Do ask them to define and clarify terminology so that you remain on the same page. Don’t assume that you can look this up later or that you are working with the same definition. Make notes of these definitions and use them when you talk to your client/manager later. Collaboration is obviously a two-way street so it can also be really useful to carefully educate the people that you work with. When teaching others you don’t want to come across as an arrogant know-it-all that knows things other people don’t. Instead, focus on the collaborative aspect and phrase it in a way that states that you can learn from each other. Everyone does have different knowledge and knowledge sharing is in general very powerful. The more that people understand how machine learning works the more they will understand the challenges you face and how their own knowledge can improve the outcome.</p>
<p>At some large organisations, there is currently a movement where AI departments are seated close to the CEO and other decision-makers. It has been shown that having casual interactions with AI practitioners increases AI favourable decision making. This makes sense as AI remains top of mind if you are constantly interacting with AI practitioners. The take-away here is that as a data scientist you should increase your interactions with the decision makers as this results in a win-win situation for everyone involved.</p>
<p>An important tool to use when speaking to your client/manager is repetition. Repetition builds trust as mirroring the problem with their own words makes them feel like you have understood the problem. So whenever possible repeat the problem you are solving with the exact words they used to describe the problem. Emphasize that you understand the problem and if needed shift the conversation by saying something like; “however in data science we use…”. Remember that you should be leading the conversation and the meeting as a whole. Aim to be doing 80% of the talking and choose what you say wisely.</p>
<p>When dealing with other people, it is important to remain kind, positive and in control of your emotions. Especially when situations become difficult. Dealing with high demanding clients/managers can be extremely frustrating and stressful. It can be good to remember that the situation is probably more stressful for them as it is for you. Management also has targets to meet and they are ultimately responsible for the success of the project even though the execution is out of their control. Empathise with them and make them feel in control by involving them in the process as much as possible. It really helps to always remain positive but realistic when speaking about your project as this gives hope without overselling your deliverables.</p>
<p>Whenever problems do occur don’t avoid them, they don’t go away just because you don’t discuss them. This is the main reason why projects fail, challenges aren’t communicated or addressed early on. Rather than see it as a problem, tackle it as a challenge, make a plan and present this new plan in a positive light. It is important to never go to your client/manager without a plan and expect them to help you figure out how your project can be saved. Your client/manager needs results and if the results they are expecting are impossible to obtain make a plan B and figure out how you could still provide value. Your client/manager wants to know that you are the best choice to work with and that you can overcome challenges and tackle them effectively. Tackling problems can allow you to show your true creativity, ensuring that you remain their first choice on future projects.</p>
<p>As a data scientist, you are your client’s/manager’s guide. You need to take responsibility for the entire project’s lifecycle. This process is in no way easy but if you define success correctly, plan, execute and communicate effectively then your project will succeed.</p>
