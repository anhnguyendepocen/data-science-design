<div id="finding-clients-and-helping-clients-find-you" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Finding clients and helping clients find you</h2>
<p>Perhaps the single question we are asked the most is, “How do I get clients?” It would be nice to be able to point to a concrete resource – a specific website with an easy-to-complete form – that functions as the freelancer analogue of a job application form. Such resources do exist – platforms where companies can post their data science needs and where contractors apply (bid) for the work. This can be a great way to find projects and to build up your data science portfolio, especially when you are starting out as a freelancer. In time, however, your role may evolve to include consulting, encompassing a lot of what we have covered in this book. In this case, many of your clients will not have a defined project, and an important part of your role will be to define and design the project based on the client’s needs. Such projects rarely appear as advertised tenders on these platforms, so you have to find them through other means.</p>
<p>So how do you find such contracts? In the case of your authors, the contracts usually found us. This is both reassuring and disconcerting: reassuring in the knowledge that you may not have to invest a lot of time and energy into obtaining work, and disconcerting in the fact that until the work starts coming to you, you are a little bit stuck. But that doesn’t mean that you are powerless – there are a number of steps you can take to help your prospective clients discover you and show why they should hire you.</p>
<div id="build-a-network" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Build a network</h3>
<p>The single best way to grow your business is through word-of-mouth referrals, so it’s critically important to create a professional network. A network is a group of relationships, and you should view your professional contacts as relationships that you want to nurture and develop. While you can not guarantee that another person will want to have a professional relationship with you, in our experience, most people are very happy to meet others and grow their networks.</p>
<p>For many of us networking doesn’t come naturally, and the prospect of having to strike up a conversation with complete strangers can be intimidating. Often the advice you hear is along the lines of, “Just get over it”, a sentiment which is both lacking in empathy and myopically unhelpful for many. Unfortunately we don’t have a magic solution for this, but we can tell you that networking is a skill like any other and that it gets easier the more you do it. If you find it difficult, the best advice we can give you is to practice: go out on a limb and try to strike up a conversation with strangers you meet. For example, if you see someone standing alone at an event, try to strike up a conversation; most likely, they would welcome you making an effort to engage them. Many people like to approach networking as a chance to step outside of themselves: if no one knows you, then you can use this as a chance to take on a different version of yourself that you don’t normally tap into. This is not to say that you should be insincere or untrue to yourself, but rather to not feel the pressure of self-consciousness. Many find this strangely liberating.</p>
<p>You should bear in mind that in professional contexts, most people are going through the same thing you are: they want to meet people and grow their networks, but may not feel entirely comfortable doing so. At the end of the day, consulting is a people business, and you need to learn to talk to people who may be very different from yourself. In other words, cast a wide net and practice the skill of bridging a communication gap between yourself and someone with a completely different background or role.</p>
<p>Data science is an exciting field with a vibrant, dynamic community. Most cities have regular Meetups and with the recent COVID-19-induced social distancing measures, many of these have been transformed into virtual formats that can help to remove geographical barriers. We strongly recommend that you find a Meetup or two that aligns with your interests and get involved. Similarly, conferences can also be a great way to meet people. Both Meetups and conferences can give you a chance to speak, and many have built-in systems to promote people who are at the early stages of their careers, such as lightning talks or travel scholarships for more junior people or those from underrepresented groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="promote-yourself" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.2</span> Promote yourself</h3>
<p>While self-promotion may feel unnatural, it is important to get the word out into the world that you exist, that you do good work and that you bring value to your clients. Ideally your amazing work will speak for itself, but the reality is that many people do amazing work, and you need to make your amazing work stand out.</p>
<p>There are several ways to promote yourself. One is to produce content that the world can ingest. For instance, presenting at conferences can be a great way to showcase what you’ve done and to give the audience a glimpse into your personality. Writing is also a good approach, although writing is often time-consuming and many of us struggle to find the time needed to do it well (including your authors).</p>
<p>Social media can also be a good way to promote yourself, especially within a data science community that is notoriously engaged in on-line discussions. This notion was elegantly encapsulated by Chris Albon, who tweeted, “Facebook is your family newsletter. LinkedIn is your resume. Twitter is the bar after the conference that perfectly matches your interests.”</p>
<p>For more concrete suggestions about how to promote yourself and develop a strong profile, we strongly recommend Build a Career in Data Science by Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis.</p>
</div>
<div id="have-a-strong-profile" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.3</span> Have a strong profile</h3>
<p>As a contractor, you will rarely use your CV to find clients. In its place will be your online profile, and it’s absolutely essential that you take the time to create one that is engaging, informative and approachable.</p>
<p>Take the time to create a LinkedIn profile that succinctly describes what you have to offer. Often our profiles evolve over time – the typical approach is to periodically add items to an existing profile that we were once happy with. This can result in a disjointed patchwork of items with no clear narrative. While it can be heartbreaking to remove achievements from the past, it’s important that your profile is current and relevant. For example, if you have entered data science after a career as an academic researcher, you may be tempted to include details of your graduate research and your publications. Most prospective clients will not care about this, and the result is a profile that looks unprofessional and lacking in substance and focus. Instead, focus on your achievements that are relevant to your data science career.</p>
<p>Having a website or a blog is also a good way to showcase your skills and expertise, as well as a convenient way to list original content. We encourage you to update your profile regularly and keep it as relevant and current as possible. As above, Robinson and Nolis provide a wealth of suggestions for how to do this.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-involved-with-your-community-both-locally-and-internationally" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.4</span> Get involved with your community, both locally and internationally</h3>
<p>A great way to expand your professional network is through community involvement. For example, the R for Data Science Online Learning Community (<a href="https://www.rfordatasci.com/" class="uri">https://www.rfordatasci.com/</a>) is an active group of nearly 6000 R enthusiasts who discuss R programming at all levels of expertise, have designated mentors who volunteer time for office hours to help others and who have several ongoing book clubs for people with common interests. For data scientists using the python stack, there are regular Pydata Meetups and conferences globally as well as others ways to get involved. Such communities can be wonderful ways to get involved with others who have shared interests and to improve your craft.</p>
<p>We also recommend contributing to open source software projects. For many who are new to the field, this can seem like something that is well beyond your expertise. However, many projects or packages rely on input from the community to maintain their work, and even contributions such as grammatical corrections, fixed typos or bug fixes are gratefully received. Many repositories will invite contributions at different levels and will even flag issues that are better-suited to those who are new to open source contributing.</p>
