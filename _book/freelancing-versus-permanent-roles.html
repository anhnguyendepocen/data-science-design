<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Freelancing versus permanent roles</h2>
<p>Many of our students are drawn to the notion of working independently.
Indeed, freelancing can be a dynamic and exhilarating way to make a living. It gives you flexibility, almost always comes with great variety in terms of the work you do and allows you to be your own boss. Permanent roles can also be dynamic and exhilarating, although it’s fair to say that they are less flexible than freelancing and rarely allow you to be your own boss. Which type of role is right for you? Naturally, that’s a question only you can answer. To help you to better understand the realities of these two paths, we discuss below some aspects that you may not have considered.</p>
<div id="flexibility" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.1</span> Flexibility</h3>
<p>While freelancing does afford you the ability to pick and choose what work you do and the flexibility to work when and where you want to, this notion can become romanticised and may not always be realistic, especially for early-career data scientists. Many clients expect you to work normal business hours and will want to have you on-sight. While remote working is becoming increasingly accepted, buy-in is not 100%. Furthermore, some companies will have strict legal restrictions on where their data can be used; the financial services industry is a notable example. When trying to build a business, you are often so focused on getting work that you will paradoxically have less freedom than someone in a permanent position. In other words, until your business is established, your need to build a client base and generate revenue can drive you to take nearly any job. While we don’t recommend you take work out of desperation, it is often the case that early-stage freelancers have less flexibility than expected. As your business grows, so will your ability to adopt a more flexible system of work. The flexibility of freelancing is real and it can be fantastically liberating. But it may not be as easy to realise as you might expect.</p>
</div>
<div id="variety" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.2</span> Variety</h3>
<p>Freelancing can be a great way to work on a wide range of problems. That said, many permanent roles also come with high degrees of variety. While you may not have as much freedom to decide exactly which problems you choose to work on, you may find that you are exposed to other aspects of the business in a permanent role that you might not otherwise have access to as a freelancer.</p>
<p>For example, many senior data scientists will become responsible for leading teams, with a career trajectory that moves towards roles that are more strategic and managerial than hands-on. The skills required for such a role are much different than those technical skills required for a job that is more focused on coding. As a freelancer, unless you want to expand your business to include staff, you would not have this sort of exposure. Of course, managerial roles are not right for everyone and are not a necessary eventuality, but the point remains that permanent roles may give you different types of variety than you may get as an independent contractor.</p>
</div>
<div id="job-stability" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.3</span> Job stability</h3>
<p>One of the major differences between operating as an independent contractor and being a permanent member of staff lies in job stability. As a freelancer, you are responsible for your own stability and for determining what sort of spending runway you would like to have for your business. Of course, no business is 100% safe from economic instability, however companies do tend to provide more stability than does the market for short-term contracts. If such stability is important to you, this may be an important factor to consider.</p>
<p>Similarly, different <em>types</em> of companies differ widely in their stability. In general, larger, more established companies will be more stable as compared to small companies and start-ups. Naturally, there are no certainties. For instance, in 2007 we saw a massive financial crisis in which numerous “too big to fail” companies went bankrupt. Of the many sectors available, government/civil service roles are among the most stable, although again, this is not a certainty.</p>
<p>Similarly, permanent roles will often come with benefits that can be massively important as well. For example, planning for your retirement is hugely important and should never be ignored, but it is something that many early-career professionals tend to overlook. As an independent contractor, it will be up to you to plan for your own retirement. Similarly, in many countries health insurance is provided by your job, at least in part. This can be a benefit that could translate into immense amounts of money in the event that you need health care, and its importance should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Relatedly, your ability to borrow money will be affected by your employment position. In the UK, for instance, it is difficult to be considered for a mortgage unless you have at least three years of positive financial records for your operation to support your application. If buying property is on your radar, this could be an important factor in your decision.</p>
</div>
<div id="legal-considerations-and-responsibilities" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.4</span> Legal considerations and responsibilities</h3>
<p>Whenever you get paid for a service, it is important to protect yourself legally. As an independent contractor, this usually means having indemnity insurance. While indemnity insurance is not usually expensive to purchase, <em>not</em> having it can be very costly should things go wrong.</p>
<p>Many freelancers choose to operate as a limited liability company. One advantage of this arrangement is that there exists a legal distinction between you (the person doing the work) and the company. If a client wants to sue you, for example, only the company is liable (unless you, as an individual, are grossly negligent). This gives you a layer of protection…legally your own possessions are protected, and only the assets of the company are vulnerable. In the UK (where both of us registered our companies), the process of setting up a company is fairly straightforward. However, there are certain legal aspects to running a company that you have to be aware of. Our advice is to find an accountant who can help you set up the company, advise on the financial operations and oversee payroll and adherence to tax and other legal obligations.</p>
<p>Operating as a business can have another benefit that is important to understand. In the UK, if a contractor works for a client in what <em>looks like</em> a permanent role, the government can stipulate that the person essentially <em>is</em> a permanent employee and should be granted all the benefits of a regular employee. For example, if you are working on a 12-month full-time contract, you will look just like a permanent member of staff. This leaves the client in a vulnerable position as they could be liable to pay back-taxes and national insurance contributions should the government deem it appropriate. For this reason, many clients will not work with sole traders – those who operate individually outside of the context of a company. If, on the other hand, you operate as a limited liability company, then legally you already have employment (you are employed by your own company) and your client will not be at-risk. The net effect is that you may find it easier to get contracts as a limited company than as a sole trader.</p>
<p>Those who are employed in permanent positions, in contrast to independent contractors (sole traders or limited companies) will generally be protected by the legal framework of their employer, so these legal issues are generally eliminated.</p>
